       **Introduction to Bit Manipulation**  

        Bit manipulation refers to the direct manipulation of individual 
        bits within a binary representation of data. It involves using 
        bitwise operators like AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), 
        left shift (`<<`), and right shift (`>>`). Bit manipulation is widely 
        used in low-level programming, optimization, cryptography, and solving 
        problems efficiently. It allows for tasks like checking, setting, flipping,
         or clearing specific bits, often leading to faster and memory-efficient 
         solutions.
